Let's create a JavaScript Guessing Game with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is a
fun JavaScript project.

## üìù Description

In this Guessing Game, I created this using HTML, CSS & JavaScript. Users can
guess the number, if it's higher or lower then it will give you a notification
to update. If it's right then it will show the correct number. Also, it will
show how many attempts you tried. I a fun experience.
